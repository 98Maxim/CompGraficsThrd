# CompGraficsThrd
Alogorithm clipping object

Main branch is matrix operation on your object. That is '3' task in my course.

'4' branch is lastest updates and fixes, and also include clipping algorithm
To see all functional, I hightly recommended switch to '4' branch

'6' branch is about "prinring" picture with txt file and commands
To use that, open file 'задание 6.txt' and write your movable commands
  
'7' branch is printing too. But it's print polygons. In 'Polygon.txt' you can see example of polygon like "phone tube". That is Kiruos-Back alghorithm.

'8' branch about painting, using fill
